# Synchrony Q4 Spending Prediction 🦝

A machine learning project built during the [UIUC Datathon 2025](https://stat.illinois.edu/datathon) to predict Q4 credit card spending of customers using real-world financial datasets from Synchrony.

## 🧠 Objective
Predict customer spending for Q4 2025 using transaction and account data from Q2–Q4 2024. Our goal was both prediction accuracy and interpretability to provide business insights.

## 📊 Key Results
- Achieved **R² = 0.7688** using a **LASSO regression** model.
- Built interpretable models for business decision-making.
- Explored multicollinearity, outliers, and feature engineering in-depth.



## 🔍 Techniques Used
- Data preprocessing, EDA, and feature engineering
- One-hot encoding and multicollinearity checks
- LASSO & Ridge regression tuning
- Residual and correlation analysis
